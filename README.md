## Jumbotron and Navbar
![Site Jumbotron](jumbotron.png)
The jumbotron and navbar for the site are styled using a CSS background pattern as well as colors picked from [colormind.io](colormind.io). The navbar is sticky to the top and remains there even when you scroll down to view more content but the jumbotron will scroll and disappear.

## Home
The home page features a banner image of Johpurs in their natural habitat, horseback! Also are content cards highlighting both the about and products pages and an area with 3 randomly selected featured products. There is also a carousel of review videos that you can click through. 

## About
The about page has information about the history of Jodhpurs and a style guide nestled within a clickable selector on the left hand side of the page. Additionally, there is a comment section that even has the ability to reply to comments built in!

## Products
The products page contains an array of all available products that you can browse through in a variety of ways. You can select a specific style by clicking one of the filer buttons or search for a specific pair by name. When you have located the pair that you like you can select a size and then add that pair to either your cart or your wishlist. 

## Cart
When you are ready to checkout you can visit the cart page to see the pants that you previously selected, a small area featuring your wishlist, and an order summary that calculates the price of your pants, tax included!

## Wishlist
The wishlist page is populated with all of the pants you want but haven't decided to go all in on just yet. You can add those pants directly to your cart from here!
