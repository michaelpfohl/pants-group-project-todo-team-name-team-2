            <h1>History of Jodhpur</h1>
            <p>
              Jodhpurs were adapted from traditional clothing of the Indian
              subcontinent as long trousers, reaching to the ankle, snug from
              the calf to the ankle, with reinforced fabric protecting the inner
              calf and knee from rubbing. The thighs and hips were flared, a
              traditional South Asian style that allowed free movement of the
              hip and thigh while riding.
            </p>
            <p>
              The jodhpurs were adapted from an ancient style of Indian trouser
              called the Churidar, which is tight around the calf and loose at
              the hips. It is still worn at traditional Jodhpuri weddings. This
              is a special traditional style of clothing in Northern India,
              especially in what is today the modern state of Rajasthan. Sir
              Pratap Singh, a younger son of the Maharaja of Jodhpur,
              popularised in England the style of riding-trousers worn in
              Jodhpur, a design that he apparently improved and perfected and
              first had tailored in India around 1890.
            </p>
            <p>
              Singh was an avid polo player. When he visited Queen Victoria in
              England during her Diamond Jubilee celebrations of 1897, he
              brought his entire polo team, who caused a sensation among the
              fashionable circles of the United Kingdom by their riding clothes.
              In addition, they won many polo matches. Singh's jodhpur style of
              flared thigh and hip was rapidly taken up by the British
              polo-playing community, who adapted it to the existing designs of
              English breeches, which ended snugly at mid-calf, and were worn
              with tall riding boots.

            <h1>Jodhpur Goes West</h1>
            <p>
              In 1897, Queen Victoria, the Monarch of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and the Empress of India, celebrated her Diamond Jubilee. During that year several rulers of the Princely States in India traveled to England to participate in the celebrations. Sir Pratap Singh, as the Regent of Jodhpur also traveled to England and took with him the Jodhpur Polo team. The team, besides winning most matches, also caused a sensation with their new breeches.  The British were quick to spot the advantages of the new design and quickly adopted them.
            </p> 
            <p>
              There is a story behind the naming of these breeches. It seemed that Sir Pratap found himself in the need for a new pair and was forced to visit a Savile Row tailor where he had no option but to reveal their design. On being asked by the tailor what the garment he ordered were called, Sir Pratap, not being too conversant with the English language, misunderstood the question and replied – Jodhpur. And the name stuck. Their use quickly spread throughout the British Empire and even crossed the Atlantic to the USA, where today a variant is called the Kentucky Jodhpur.
            </p>
            <p>
              With the increasing popularity of sports and sporting activities , the Jodhpur pants started making an appearance on the tennis court , the ski slopes , and also among aviation and motor car sports. During the 1920s when women began to ride astride saddle , they chose the Jodhpur and Coco Chanel was reportedly the first high profile woman to wear them. Amelia Earhart and Amy Johnson were the other famous women who donned Jodhpur pants and many young women of the times , no doubt inspired by them , began to wear Jodhpur pants as both fashion wear and sports wear including dancing ! Their popularity among women continued till the Second World War where they were part of the uniform of the Womens Land Army.

            <h1>Style Guide</h1>
            <p>
              For those brave souls who have the ability to carry off anything they wear, the classic Jodhpuri Coat / Jodhpur pants combination can make them stand out in a sea of suits. It is recommended that you wear this combination only if you have the confidence to carry it off. Both contrasting and matching colors can be worn. It is advisable to follow the same guidelines ( for shoes and accessories ) as you would when wearing a western suit. A pocket square can be added for a bit of color. The brass buttons of the coat can be replaced with traditional suit buttons. Solid colors are recommended or thin pin stripes at the most. Shirt cuffs are usually not displayed while wearing Jodhpuri Coats; however the wearer can exercise his discretion.
            </p>
            <p>
              For those who prefer a less formal look, the Jodhpur pants can be worn with an Oxford Cloth Button Down shirt. For an even more casual look the shirt can be kept untucked and the sleeves folded up. Shirts with long tails and two back pleats packed under the shoulders as in the British style are more suited to this style though centre box pleats will also do. The back shoulder pleats add to the drape of the shirt when worn untucked.  A military style shirt with a placket, large pockets with buttoned flaps and shoulder straps go very well with Jodhpur pants to create a more outdoor look. In fact this look was very popular in pre – independent India among the cavalry officers at the time.  Sandals, flip flops, short boots or boat shoes can all be worn with this combination. For a even more casual look the shirt can be replaced with a Polo shirt or any casual T Shirt. In a nutshell if you let the Jodhpur Pants replace your trousers, whether they be formal, chinos or jeans is up to you but owning at least one pair to combine with tweed jackets, could be a fantastic addition to your wardrobe.
            </p>
            <p>
               Jodhpur pants worn with tall boots has been incorporated into the uniform of motorcycle policemen all over the world and this look can be modified to suit you if you like to ride motorcycles. Leather jackets go extremely well with this combination.
